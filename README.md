# Flowers-Classification
This project uses Oxford of 102 flower categories to train a deep learning model to can recognize and classify different species of flowers. The trained model is then applied on a mobile application to such that the mobile can classify the species of flowers using the device's camera.

# Usage
- This project starts with importing libraries and loading image dataset
- Exploring images, perfrom label mapping using json, image processing and standarzation
- Build the classifier using transfer learning from Tensorflow hub (mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4)
- Define the model parameters and plot the model loss and accuracy graphs
- Use Keras model and inference for classification
- Perform Sanity Check
